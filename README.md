## 🚀 Features

- **⚡️ Blazing Fast**: Leverages Bun's native `serve` API for maximum throughput.
- **📦 Zero Config**: Start serving files instantly with a single command.
- **📁 Directory Listing**: Automatically generates a clean HTML listing for directories (if no `index.html` is present).
- **💾 Caching**: Built-in memory caching for high-performance asset delivery.
- **📝 Advanced Logging**: Optional request logging to console or persistent files.
- **🚫 Zero Dependencies**: No 3rd party dependencies used therefore, better safety + better optimization + less vulnerabilities.
- **🛠 Customizable**: Fine-grained control over ports, hostnames, and root directories.

## 📦 Installation

You can run `bunserv` directly using `bunx`:
